# Add to Cart Woocommerce plugin
Custom Add to Cart (and more features) plugin for WooCommerce

This was a freelance task with a limit of 5 hours for development, in which the goal was to create a WooCommerce plugin with a list of features.
This was also my first time developing a WooCommerce plugin.

Development notes:

  I decided to place the plugin menu directly on the left navigation menu just for convenience;
  
  I decided to use jQuery as well as vanilla JavaScript in order to speed up the development process;
  
  I tested everything in a localhost environment so there could be some unforeseen behaviours related to that (unlikely, however);
  

This is what I would improve before considering the plugin done:

  Responsive design (resolution breakpoints for the popup, possibly for the Plugin admin panel);
  
  Allow addition/removal of more than one display condition at a time (currently only 1);
  
  Redesign Plugin Admin UI;
  
  Change variable and function names to be more understandable for others;
  
  Quick user guide / documentation;
  
  Extensive Display Conditions testing;
  
  Convert jQuery code in addtocart-popup-script.js to vanilla JS;
  
  Separate all .css styles to a separate file (\plugins\addtocart-popup\assets\addtocart-popup.css);
  
  Add option for popup to appear sliding from the right of the screen or fading in/out;
